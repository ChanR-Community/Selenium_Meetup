# This is a markdown file to install different drivers
---

### First lets see how to install a driver

We will be using chromedriver for this example as its the most common browser. For other drivers the initialization will be similar.

1. Download chromedirver from [here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html).

2. The select your Operating System.

3. It will be downloaded in a zip file so extract that

4. Open the folder where you extracted it and copy and paste it to the folder where you will code.

5. Completed! (More will be discussed in the Meetup)

### Now here are the links to different drivers

- [Chromium/Chrome](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
- [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
- [Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
- [Internet Explorer(IE)](https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
- Safari is built in
- [Opera](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases)

If your browser is not mentioned, either its dosen't exist or selenium dosen't support it.

If you faced installation problems then we can resolve them in the Meetup or you could join our community [discord](https://discord.gg/C97U2APhAG).
